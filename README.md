### How to install?
1. Make sure you have native Discord application installed with [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net)
2. Locate the BetterDiscord plugin folder
  * %appdata%/BetterDiscord/plugins
  * or Settings>BetterDiscord>Plugins>Open Plugin Folder
3. Copy file 'Quicksave.plugin.js' to the plugin folder
4. Reload/restart Discord (CTRL+R)
5. Go to Settings>BetterDiscord>Plugins
6. Enable this plugin
7. Go to the plugin settings and set a download directory.


### Notes
- The plugin will download images from their original URLs. This is done because Discord rehosted images are usually compressed.
- This will reveal your IP address to the server when downloading.
- The plugin wont check the files itself in case of viruses or stuff like that.
- MIT license. Use at your own risk.
