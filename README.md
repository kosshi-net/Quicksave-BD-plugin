### Notes
- The plugin will download images from their original URLs. This is done because Discord rehosted images are usually compressed.
- This will reveal your IP address to the server when downloading.
- The plugin wont check the files itself in case of viruses or stuff like that.
- MIT license. Use at your own risk.
